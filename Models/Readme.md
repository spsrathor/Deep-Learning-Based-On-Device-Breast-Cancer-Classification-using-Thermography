Experimentation with 13 models was done with fine-tunning resulting in the below given accuracies and size of the models.

A = Accuracy of a Transfer Learning model, AF = Acuraccy of a fine-tunned model (All layers unfreezed).

### Finally, MobileNetV2 was selected because of the smaller size and quite good accuracy.
