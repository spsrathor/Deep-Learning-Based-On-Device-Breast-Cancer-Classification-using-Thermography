# Deep-Learning-Based-On-Device-Breast-Cancer-Classification-using-Thermography
An android application for classification of thermal images of Breast using MobileNet

Dataset is acquired from [Database for Mastology Research with Infrared Image(DMR-IR)](https://visual.ic.uff.br/dmi/). Dataset contains IR images and thermal maps taken in two protocols:-
> 1.  Dynamic Infrared Thermography (DIT)
> 2.  Static Infrared Thermography (SIT)

Both protocols contains
> 1. Grayscale image
> 2. Thermal Maps

In this work Thermal maps of both protocols are used. Thermal maps are similar to heat maps, they contain arrays of temperature at a given point in the image.

Experimentation with 13 models was done with fine-tunning.

Taking size and accuracy into conideration, an android application was made. Screenshots of the Android Application are given below-
